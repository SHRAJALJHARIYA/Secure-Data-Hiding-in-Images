Here's a detailed project description for your **Steganography-Based Image Encryption & Decryption Tool**:  

---

# **Steganography-Based Image Encryption & Decryption Tool**  
### **Overview**  
This project is a **Flask-based web application** that allows users to securely hide and retrieve messages within images using **steganography**. The tool ensures that sensitive information is concealed within an image using the **Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography** method and can only be retrieved with the correct decryption key.

---

### **Features**  
✅ **Image Encryption (Steganography)**  
- Users can upload an image, enter a secret message, and provide an encryption key.  
- The message is embedded within the image using **LSB steganography**.  
- The encrypted image is available for download.  

✅ **Image Decryption**  
- Users can upload an encrypted image and enter the correct decryption key.  
- The application extracts the hidden message only if the provided key matches.  

✅ **Secure Key-Based Access**  
- The message is encrypted along with a **key** to ensure only authorized users can retrieve the hidden information.  

✅ **User-Friendly Interface**  
- Simple UI for easy encryption and decryption.  
- Toggle between encryption and decryption sections.  

✅ **Modular Code Structure**  
- **Encryption and decryption logic are separated** into dedicated files for better maintainability.  
- Flask **Blueprints** for scalable and modular development.

### **How It Works?**  
1️⃣ **Encryption Process:**  
   - Upload an image.  
   - Enter a secret message and an encryption key.  
   - The message is hidden in the image using **LSB steganography**.  
   - Download the encrypted image.  

2️⃣ **Decryption Process:**  
   - Upload the encrypted image.  
   - Enter the correct decryption key.  
   - If the key matches, the hidden message is revealed.

### **Setup & Installation**  
1️⃣ Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/steganography-tool.git
   cd steganography-tool
   ```

2️⃣ Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3️⃣ Run the Flask application:

### **Future Improvements**  
✔️ Add AES encryption for an extra security layer.  
✔️ Support for multiple image formats (JPG, BMP, etc.).  
✔️ Implement a **GUI-based desktop application**.  

---

### **Conclusion**  
This project provides a simple and effective way to **securely hide messages** in images using **steganography**. It is useful for anyone looking to **safeguard sensitive data** in a visually imperceptible way.
